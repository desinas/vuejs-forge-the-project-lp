# Vue.js Forge Official SaaS App Landing Page Repo

We're super excited to be teaming up with the community to build a SaaS Project Management App together! 

During the event we'll not only build a Project Management SaaS application together but we'll even put together an awesome marketing landing page with Nuxt.js and ButterCMS.

Use this repo to keep up with the landing page code as it's being worked on live by event speakers.
